Jolyon Palmer thinks more F1 safety measures could be implemented as a result of Zhou Guanyu’s terrifying Silverstone crash.

On the run to the first corner of the British Grand Prix, Zhou’s Alfa Romeo was clipped by George Russell’s Mercedes, causing his car to turn upside down and skate through the gravel in a spinning motion before vaulting the tyre barrier and hitting the catch fencing floor first.

News of the Chinese racer’s condition was worryingly slow to emerge, but miraculously he was stretchered away from the car with no injuries and was later pictured talking to F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali in the paddock.

But an incident like that – the most horrifying in Formula 1 since Romain Grosjean’s Bahrain fireball crash in November 2020 – is sure to spark an investigation, with Zhou having credited the Halo device with saving his life.

Palmer, speaking to Formula 1, thinks the FIA will look to see if further improvements can be made – while acknowledging the current measures should be lauded for preventing serious injury, at the very least, to Zhou.

“Really amazing and again it’s a testament to safety in Formula 1 that you can have that accident,” said the ex-Renault driver.

“Actually, as it happened, I saw the red flag was flown straight away and you didn’t realise the extent of it until you saw actually the car had flipped over the barrier, which was incredible to see. It’s not very often that happens.”

Sergio Perez has admitted he “got lucky” with the Safety Car that propelled him back into podium contention at the British Grand Prix.

The Mexican’s top-three chances looked all but over when he was forced into the pits on lap six for a new front wing, having suffered damage during contact with Charles Leclerc as the Ferrari squeezed through on the inside.

Largely unnoticed amid a three-way tussle at the front, the Red Bull driver crept back up to fourth but was still well adrift until a Safety Car period, triggered by Esteban Ocon’s Alpine stopping on track with a fuel pump failure.

With his team-mate Max Verstappen nursing a damaged car in P7, Perez was right back in the mix and, stopping for soft tyres like most of the other front-runners, he suddenly found himself potentially even a victory candidate given his car’s pace if he could pull off some moves.

Perez did get past Lewis Hamilton when racing resumed, then added the scalp of Leclerc – who was left out on hard tyres – and although he could not challenge eventual winner Carlos Sainz, a runner-up finish must have been more than he had dared to envisage after that early pit-stop.

“I was unfortunate with Charles on the first lap,” said Perez at the post-race press conference.

“There was not much room for three cars and unfortunately I took the worst part of it. I got front wing damage, which on these cars they said it didn’t affect that much, but for me I had no front end.

“I was forced to pit and basically I went all the way to last and just recovered from there, lap after lap.

“The medium tyres were holding on pretty nicely and we got lucky with the Safety Car at the end, which gave us a good opportunity to fight for the podium.

“When the Safety Car came out, it meant we were in P4. So then it was a good chance. And then it was epic final laps.”

Fresh off the back of a thrilling British Grand Prix, Formula 1 quickly moves on to Red Bull’s home turf for the Austrian Grand Prix.

Red Bull’s lead title charger Max Verstappen suffered further Silverstone disappointment when he sustained damage from a piece of debris which severely impacted his performance and took him out of the equation for the podium, never mind victory.

But a further strategical wobble from Ferrari meant Charles Leclerc could not take full advantage, finishing only P4 as he slipped backwards in a frantic final few laps, Ferrari choosing to retain track position during a Safety Car period rather than pitting him for fresh soft tyres like those around him.

It was not all doom and gloom for Red Bull and Ferrari though. Carlos Sainz seized the opportunity to become a race winner in Formula 1 for the first time, while Sergio Perez’s P2 cushioned the blow for Red Bull in the Constructors’, bringing himself to within 34 points of Verstappen in the process.

Verstappen has won three of the latest four Austrian GPs but as well as Ferrari, Mercedes also were a threat at Silverstone and so could be on the scene once more at the Red Bull Ring.

And remember, sprint qualifying returns this weekend to add some extra spice!
